  Hi üëã, I'm Thiago! A passionate Ciber Security student from Brazil.

  -  I‚Äôm currently studying Analysis and Systems Development and Digital Security at UNINASSAU. I've been a technology enthusiast since I was a child, I've always been fascinated with solving problems logically, both in games and in everyday life.

  -  I am looking for my first job opportunity. My dream is to one day work with Ciber Security, but I'm open to new challenges. I recently completed the CS50 course, where I acquired skills in C#, Full Stack Web Development and became capable of creating technological solutions.
